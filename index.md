**Please note**

This plugin is built on the assumption that the legend is in the bottom right corner of the layout and not bigger than the folded format. Currently only works on the first page of a layout. 

# Backlog
- Better documentation about how to fold a printed layout.
- Option to choose corner of legend position in layout.
- Other languages.
- Support for multiple pages.
- Automatic paper size/thickness adjustments.
